- **1b.**

Quicksort: 
- O(nlogn) complexity for the average case 
- O(n^2) for worst case
Selection sort:
- O(n^2) for average case 
- O(n^2) for worst case


- **1c.**
Timesort is faster than the other sorting algorithms provided in this lab. This is true for all of the list sizes that were tested.
